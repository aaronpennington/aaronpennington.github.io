Powercast is a podcast application for Android smartphones. For my senior project at BYU-Idaho, I developed both the front-end Android application as well as a back-end Node.js server. The server uses Listennotes API to fetch and send podcast data. 

Developing this application helped me gain a lot of important experience in a wide variety of development technologies and tools. 

In my free time, I continue to work on the project, and I hope to be able to publish it to an app store someday soon!
